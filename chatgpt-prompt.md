Python rubik’s cube is there a way to, for a given algorithm (Ua perm reversed for example), it generates an other random algorithm, that will gives the same state as the other algorithm, but that is also enough different so that seeing this alg I have no clue that it would give this state (here for example, it would give the Ua perm). Is there a way, a module, a library for that ? (Can also be another language, it’s just I prefer python)

Yes, what you're looking for is a way to generate an alternative algorithm that results in the same cube state but is different enough that it wouldn't be obviously linked to the original algorithm. There are a few ways to approach this:

### 1. **Using Cube Libraries (e.g., `Kociemba`, `rubik-cube-NxNxN`)**
Several libraries can be used to manipulate and analyze Rubik's Cube moves:

- [`kociemba`](https://pypi.org/project/kociemba/) (Python implementation of the optimal solver)
- [`rubik-cube-NxNxN`](https://github.com/markusq/rubik) (for more general cube operations)

You can:
1. **Apply your given algorithm to the solved cube** to get a specific cube state.
2. **Generate alternative algorithms** that reach the same state but are significantly different.

Example:
```python
import kociemba
from rubik.cube import Cube

# Define the original algorithm (e.g., Ua perm reversed)
original_moves = "U' M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'"  # Example Ua perm reversed

# Apply the original algorithm to the solved cube
cube = Cube()  # Start with a solved cube
cube.sequence(original_moves)  # Apply the algorithm

# Get the resulting cube state
final_state = cube.__str__()  # The cube's state as a string

# Find another sequence that leads to the same state
alternative_moves = kociemba.solve("UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB", final_state)

print("Original algorithm:", original_moves)
print("Alternative algorithm:", alternative_moves)
```
This will return an alternative move sequence that leads to the same result.

### 2. **Using Randomization & Search Heuristics**
If you want **non-trivial** alternative solutions, you can:
1. **Apply a random sequence of moves.**
2. **Solve the cube back to the same state using a solver.**
3. **Check if the new sequence is significantly different from the original.**
4. **Keep doing this until you find an algorithm that looks completely unrelated.**

For example:
```python
import random
from rubik.cube import Cube

def generate_random_alg(n=10):
    moves = ["U", "U'", "U2", "D", "D'", "D2", "L", "L'", "L2",
             "R", "R'", "R2", "F", "F'", "F2", "B", "B'", "B2"]
    return " ".join(random.choices(moves, k=n))

def get_alternative_algorithm(original_moves):
    cube = Cube()
    cube.sequence(original_moves)  # Apply the original algorithm
    final_state = cube.__str__()  # Get the final state

    while True:
        random_moves = generate_random_alg(10)  # Generate a random scramble
        cube_copy = Cube()
        cube_copy.sequence(random_moves)
        
        # Solve from this random state to the desired state
        try:
            recovery_moves = kociemba.solve(cube_copy.__str__(), final_state)
            alternative_moves = random_moves + " " + recovery_moves

            if alternative_moves != original_moves:
                return alternative_moves
        except:
            continue  # If solving fails, try again

alternative = get_alternative_algorithm("U' M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'")
print("Alternative algorithm:", alternative)
```
This method:
- Generates a **random sequence** to mix up the solution.
- Uses a solver to **correct back** to the desired state.
- Ensures the new sequence is different enough from the original.

### 3. **Use Group Theory (Conjugation & Commutators)**
Another way is to conjugate the Ua perm (or any algorithm) with another move sequence:
1. Pick a **random move sequence** `X`.
2. Compute `X * Ua-perm * X'` (conjugation).
3. The result will still be a Ua permutation but will look different.

Example in notation:
```python
X = "R U R' U'"  # Random moves
Ua_perm = "U' M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'"
alternative = X + " " + Ua_perm + " " + X[::-1]
print("Alternative algorithm:", alternative)
```
This **hides** the Ua perm within a different sequence.

---

### **Conclusion**
There is no perfect way to make a completely "random" equivalent algorithm, but you can:
1. **Use `kociemba.solve()`** to find alternative solutions.
2. **Use random scrambles and solve back** for diverse algorithms.
3. **Use conjugation tricks** to make a sequence look different while achieving the same effect.
